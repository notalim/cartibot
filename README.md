# Playbot Carti 
 Discord bot based on the famous music artist Playboi Carti. It's a project for fun and passion for Carti's music.

### What it can do now

`!cartify <message`: the Bot transforms the text of the message similar to how Carti would tweet & text in the eras of *"Die Lit"* and pre-*"Whole Lotta Red"*.

`!bars <number of lines>`: the Bot spits out random lines from one of his songs. The amount of lines is determined by the second parameter. I used my own *geniusthief* python script to scrape all lyrics into one textfile.


`!tweet`: the Bot spits out a random Carti tweet.

### Fluff

`!hello`: the Bot says hi. In it's own way.

`!disaster`: the Bot reminds of a disaster. 

### TODO or what it eventually will do (you can help me implement it!)

`!insta`: the Bot outputs a random Cart Insta post.

* use Twitter API to get the Tweets instead of hardcoding them.

> Most function names are TBD.
