# Playbot Carti Discord Bot

> version: 0.4.3

 Discord bot based on the famous music artist Playboi Carti. It's a project for fun and passion for Carti's music.

 Add it to you Discord server: [link](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=1083268096032243742&scope=bot
).

### What it can do now

`!cartify <message`: the Bot transforms the text of the message similar to how Carti would tweet & text in the eras of *"Die Lit"* and pre-*"Whole Lotta Red"*.

`!bars <number of lines>`: the Bot spits out random lines from one of his songs. The amount of lines is determined by the second parameter. If no number of lines are give, bot gives 1-3 lines. I used my own *geniusthief* python script to scrape all lyrics into one textfile. 

`!tweet`: the Bot spits out a random Carti tweet.

`!hello`: the Bot says hi and gives today's daily lyrics. In it's own way.

`!daily`: the Bot says today's daily lyrics.

### Fluff

`!cartihelp`: ask Bot for the command list.

`!disaster`: the Bot reminds of a disaster. 

`!peak`: the Bot reminds of peak. 

`!mid`: the Bot reminds that mid doesn't exist.

### TODO or what it eventually will do (you can help me implement it!)

`!insta`: the Bot outputs a random Cart Insta post.

`!quote`: the Bot will say something like.. "As I once said in <song_name>: ..." and give the bars from that song.

* use Twitter API to get the Tweets instead of hardcoding them.

> Most function names are TBD.

#### and probably more...maybe.

## Setting up the bot

To set up the bot you will need to rename bot_public.py to bot.py and change the TOKEN string there.
