Lyrics from Snippets
I just left the studio, did—, oh
I just left the studio, did twenty-four songs
I been on my shit, I been off the grid
I can't disappear, I gotta watch my kid
I gotta watch my shit, I gotta watch my six
Everything ain't real, shit don't make no sense
Shit don't make no sense, shit, I know it not real
All them days not fun, niggas all over there, they mad
I don't give a fuck at all, I don't give a fuck at all
I just left the studio, did twenty-four songs
I been on my shit, I been off the grid
I can't disappear, I gotta watch my kid
I gotta watch my shit, I gotta watch my six
